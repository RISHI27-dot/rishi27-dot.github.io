Hello there, I am Rishikesh Donadkar. 

I am a final-year student at VJTI, Mumbai. I am an [artist](https://www.instagram.com/the_artistic_subtlety/?igsh=MWxwZHBocmJzNzEyZQ%3D%3D) by nature and [engineer](https://github.com/RISHI27-dot) by passion. I love to delve into the intricacies of computing which has led me to pursue a career as a system software engineer. Additionally, I find fulfillment in working within fields revolving around system software such as [Robotics](https://sravjti.in/), Machine Learning, AI, and High-Performance Computing.

<br>

My motivation to learn new technologies and enhance my skills stems from the belief that true engineering excellence lies in the ability to create refined products and projects through the practical application of theoretical knowledge. 

I aspire to be recognized as one of the **greatest engineers the world has ever seen**.
